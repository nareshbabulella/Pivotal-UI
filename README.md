 Here we have used gulp to integrate our project 

Gulp is a tool that helps you out with several tasks when it comes to web development. It's often used to do front end tasks like:
    
    Spinning up a web server
    Reloading the browser automatically whenever a file is saved
    Using preprocessors like Sass or LESS
    Optimizing assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images
